PROBLEM WITH D3.js
var thing = !{data}[0].id
console.log("this is thing", thing)
console.log("big ass gross message: ", !{data}[0].id)

JADE/PUG doesn't want to pass it's data it gets from the server to a JS script

turns it into a string, also replaces all quote marks with &quot

but this seems to work in the js script: console.log("big ass gross message: ", !{data}[0].id)

THIS WORKS!!:

FIRST JSON stringify on server:

    router.get("/", function(req, res, next) {
      res.render("chart", {data: JSON.stringify(dbData)});
    });

SECOND, declare it script inside of !{}:

    var data = !{data};
